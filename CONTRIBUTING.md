# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! Following these guidelines helps keep the project maintainable, easy to contribute to, and more secure.

## Where to start

There are many ways to contribute.
You can fix a bug, improve the documentation, submit bug reports and feature requests, or take a first shot at a feature you need for yourself.

Pull requests are necessary for all contributions of code or documentation.

## Fixing a typo or other small issue

Many fixes require little effort or review, such as:

- Typos, white space and formatting changes
- Comment clean up
- Change logging messages or debugging output

These small changes can be made directly in GitHub if you like.

In the GitHub web UI, click the pencil icon above the file to edit the file directly in your browser.
This will automatically create a fork and pull request with the change.
See: [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

## Bug fixes and features

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix, go through the process of making a fork and pull request yourself:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Clone the fork locally
3. Make the changes in your local clone
4. Push the changes from your local clone to your remote fork
5. Create a pull request in the main repository to pull the changes from your fork.

The pull request should be a single commit.

Please use a clear commit message. We'll review every PR and might offer feedback or request changes before merging.
