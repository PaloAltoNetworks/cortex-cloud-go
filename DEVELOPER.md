# Development

This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up your dev environment for modifying, building and running the Cortex Cloud Go SDK locally 

## Dependencies

#### Required

  - Go 1.24.0+

#### Optional

  - Copywrite v0.22.0+
    - `brew tap hashicorp/tap`
    - `brew install hashicorp/tap/copywrite`

<!-- TODO: list additional optional dependencies (gosec) with installation instructions -->

## Workspace

Run the `work` recipe to initialize/update the Go workspace file:
```
make work
```

## Build

Use the `build` recipe to build all modules:
```
make build
```

## Testing

Use the `test` recipe to execute both the unit and acceptance test suites:
```
make test
```

Note that the acceptance test suite requires a Cortex Cloud API key and key ID with the appropriate permissions. See the [Acceptance Tests](#acceptance-tests) section below for more information.

### Unit Tests

Use the `test-unit` recipe to execute the unit test suite:
```
make test-unit
```
You may also override the `TEST_PACKAGE` variable to execute the unit tests for a specific package:
```
make test-unit TEST_PACKAGE=internal/app
```

### Acceptance Tests

Use the `test-acc` recipe to run the acceptance test suite:
```
make test-acc
```

To run the acceptance test suite, you must have a Cortex Cloud API key and key ID.
<!-- TODO: add link to API key creation doc page -->

If you are running the entire acceptance test suite, your API key must be associated with a user that has Instance Administrator permissions.

You must also provide the API URL for the Cortex Cloud tenant.
<!-- TODO: add guidance for finding API URL -->

Once you have obtained your API key and URL, set the following environment variables with the appropriate values:
  - `CORTEX_API_URL`
  - `CORTEX_API_KEY`
  - `CORTEX_API_KEY_ID`
